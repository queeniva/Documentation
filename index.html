                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                use a package that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into an infinite scrolling list. You can also find this codelab on flutter.dev.</li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0">Write your first Flutter app, part 2 </a> Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. In part two, you’ll

                <section class="main-section" id="Development">

                    <h3>Measuring your app's size</h3>
                    <p>Many developers are concerned with the size of their compiled app. As the APK, app bundle, or IPA version of a Flutter app is self-contained and holds all the code and assets needed to run the app, its size can be a concern. The larger
                        an app, the more space it requires on a device, the longer it takes to download, and it may break the limit of useful features like Android instant apps.</p>
                    <h3>Checking the total size</h3>

                    <p>A default release build, such as one created by
                        <a href="">flutter build apk </a> or <a href="">flutter build ios</a>, is built to conveniently assemble your upload package to the Play Store and App Store. As such, they’re also not representative of your end-users’ download
                        size. The stores generally reprocess and split your upload package to target the specific downloader and the downloader’s hardware, such as filtering for assets targeting the phone’s DPI, filtering native libraries targeting the
                        phone’s CPU architecture.</p>

                    <h3>Performance best practices</h3>
                    <p>Generally, Flutter applications are performant by default, so you only need to avoid common pitfalls to get excellent performance instead of needing to micro-optimize with complicated profiling tools. These best recommendations will
                        help you write the most performant Flutter app possible.</p>
                    <p>If you are writing web apps in Flutter, you might be interested in a series of articles, written by the Flutter Material team, after they modified the Flutter Gallery app to make it more performant on the web:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optimizing performance in Flutter web apps with tree shaking and deferred loading</li>
                        <li>Improving perceived performance with image placeholders, precaching, and disabled navigation transitions</li>

                    <h3>Flutter compatibility policy</h3>
                    <p>The Flutter team tries to balance the need for API stability with the need to keep evolving APIs to fix bugs, improve API ergonomics, and provide new features in a coherent manner. To this end, we have created a test registry where
                        you can provide unit tests for your own applications or libraries that we run on every change to help us track changes that would break existing applications. Our commitment is that we won’t make any changes that break these tests
                        without working with the developers of those tests to (a) determine if the change is sufficiently valuable, and (b) provide fixes for the code so that the tests continue to pass.</p>
                    <h3>Announcements and migration guides</h3>
                    <p>
                        If we do make a breaking change (defined as a change that caused one or more of these submitted tests to require changes), we will announce the change on our
                        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce">flutter-announce </a> mailing list as well as in our release notes.
